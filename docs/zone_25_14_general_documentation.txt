🔥 Meaning Behind "Zone 25-14"
Zone 25-14 represents my and my friend's birth dates combined:

My Birthday → 08.09 (August 9th)
My Friend's Birthday → 17.05 (May 17th)
25-14 comes from adding our birthdates:
08 + 17 = 25

It’s a personal and symbolic number, representing both of us as the founders of the project while keeping a mysterious & powerful name.
