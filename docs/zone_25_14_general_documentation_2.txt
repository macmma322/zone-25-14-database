🔥 ZONE 25-14 – OFFICIAL BRAND & VISION DOCUMENTATION

───────────────────────────────────────────────
🔥 ORIGIN STORY – THE BIRTH OF ZONE 25-14
───────────────────────────────────────────────
This all began with a dream — one shared between two kids who felt like the world didn’t have a place for them.

They grew up in Bulgaria, spending their days imagining a life where they could build something of their own. A place where people like them — quiet, creative, misunderstood, passionate — could belong. They talked about business, community, anime, fast cars, deep topics, and designing a future that looked nothing like what they were born into.

No one else believed in them. No one else needed to.

For years, they supported each other through everything. That bond became the foundation of a vision — Zone 25-14. The numbers came from their birthdays, but the meaning was deeper. It was about creation, identity, and brotherhood.

Later, a lifelong friend — someone who had spent most of his life working hard and living far from them — was pulled back into the fold. The Holy Trio was finally complete. The plan wasn’t just a dream anymore. It was happening.

Zone 25-14 is built from hardship. From isolation. From long talks under the stars about what could be. But more than that, it’s built from love — love for anime, machines, rebellion, code, and each other.

> This isn’t a company. This is a **movement**.  
> For the loners, the misfits, the night owls, the dreamers.  
> For those who never gave up — even when no one else cared.  
> Welcome to the Zone.
